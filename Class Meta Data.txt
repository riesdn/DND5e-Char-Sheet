
--- CLASSES ---
* These are for MODIFIERS and SKILL SAVING THROWS, NOT skill points!
* Proficiency bonuses go to BASE STAT SAVING THROWS (marked with !) and to  a certain 
  number of specific skills listed. The appropriate skill checkboxes will become available 
  to the user for selection, and marked skills will change the appropriate modifiers. When
  the specified amount of skills are marked, the rest of the checkboxes will be disabled again.

(
  As of May 2019, Base Stat Saving Throws are not reflected in this webapp. 
  I'm currently thinking of different ways to include it without cluttering 
  everything too much. It is kept in the meta data so I don't have to hunt
  down this information again should I figure out the best way to include it.
